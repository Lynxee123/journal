## Who am I?
Heyo! My name is Lilian and welcome to my blog/journal :)

I'm a student at Bellingham Technical College, making my way through the tech world. I love solving challenges and figuring out how things work—whether it’s through CTFs, homelabs, or experimenting with new tech. Lately, I’ve been diving into my Proxmox homelab, trying to wrap my head around Docker (ﾉಥ益ಥ)ﾉ. Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about creating a more inclusive and welcoming space in IT, especially for women entering the field. I want to help break barriers and make tech a place where everyone feels like they belong!

Some fun facts: I have a deep appreciation for ‘70s and ‘80s music—especially rock, metal, and new wave. Rush, in particular, is the greatest band of all time (and I will debate this). When I’m not combing through a band's entire discography, I’m probably watching one of my comfort shows/movies. I have a soft spot for anything science fiction or historical—Doctor Who and Pride & Prejudice being personal favorites. ♡ ～('▽^人)

In my rare moments of non-tech-related productivity, I like to knit and bake bread, because having a backup plan as a sweater artisan and focaccia bread entrepenuer seems reasonable in this day and age (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧. I’m also teaching myself electric guitar, though at this rate, I should just stick with the techy stuff...
