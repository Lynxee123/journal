## **Introduction**
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure communication between computers over a potentially unsecured network, like the internet. It is primarily used to remotely access and manage servers, devices, and systems. (ง ื▿ ื)ว
### **Capabilities of SSH:**
- **Encrypted Communication**: SSH ensures that data sent between the client (your computer) and the server is encrypted, which protects it from eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: SSH uses key-based or password-based authentication to verify the identity of the client and server before establishing a connection. The most secure form is public-key authentication, where a private key on the client is matched with a public key stored on the server.
- **Command Execution**: SSH allows users to execute commands remotely on a server. For example, you can manage files, install software, or configure system settings as if you were physically at the server, all through the command line.
