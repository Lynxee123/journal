## **Importing Personal SSH Keys**

>[!abstract] **Applicable to Personal / Home Lab setup**

1. Import the user’s GitHub keys so they can ssh from their computer:
    - If any new SSH keys from other devices are added, this command needs to be done again

```
ssh-import-id-gh [GITHUB USERNAME]
```

## Importing Other User's Keys
> [!abstract] Allowing other _trusted_ users ssh access to a system requires more steps:

1. 1. In the sys-admin’s shell, ssh into the system (e.g. node, VM, etc.) you want to give access to, and then escalate to superuser:
```
sudo su -
```

2. Create the new user and then add them to sudoers group:  
    - Set an easy temporary password for the user (e.g. password)
```
adduser [USER]
usermod -aG sudo [USER]
```

3. Switch the newly created user account:
```
sudo su [USER] -
```

4. 4. Import the user’s GitHub keys so they can ssh from their computer:
```
ssh-import-id-gh [GITHUB USERNAME]
```

5. Have user ssh into the system and change their password into something secure:  
    - If any new SSH keys from other devices are added, this command needs to be done again
```
passwd
```
