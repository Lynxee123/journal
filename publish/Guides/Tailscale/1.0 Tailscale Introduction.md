#### **Introduction**
Tailscale is a modern, easy-to-use VPN (Virtual Private Network) service that allows you to securely connect your devices, no matter where they are, as if they were on the same private network ⊂( ' ▽ ' )⊃. Unlike traditional VPNs, Tailscale is built on WireGuard, making it fast, secure, and simple to set up without complex firewall or router configurations. Instead of routing all your internet traffic through a centralized VPN server (like traditional VPNs), Tailscale creates a private peer-to-peer (P2P) network between your devices.

A huge feature of Tailscale is: _Advertised Routes_. This allows a device to act as a gateway, enabling access to an entire subnet or network rather than just the device itself. This is useful for connecting to on-premises resources, remote office networks, or private cloud environments without setting up a full VPN. When a device advertises a route _(e.g. 192.168.1.0/24)_, other Tailscale nodes can send traffic to that subnet securely over Tailscale’s encrypted mesh network, eliminating the need for complex firewall or VPN configurations. This makes remote access seamless while maintaining security and ease of use. Using this service with [SSH](https://wiki.raspberrypiclub.org/books/how-to-ssh/page/what-is-ssh) allows for maximum security and convenience. Tailscale makes your remote machine feel like it’s on the same network, and SSH lets you control it once connected.  ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆
