Today was the first day of the internship. 

Got a name badge and got work emails sorted.

Finished online orientation and met most of the IT team. 

Shadowed help desk coworker and learned about some of calls they get. One interesting call was about an EKG machine not working. 

Learned about some of the various software and ticketing system that I haven't worked with yet.
