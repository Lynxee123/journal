Started off the day with a morning meeting with bagels! Everyone just went around and said one or two things that they were already/going to work on for the day. 

Went to two clinics today: SFM and NSFM. 

At SFM, we had to put in some extension for the power coords bc some of the phones we installed on [[Day 5 - Installation Station | Day 5]] were limited because it was poorly designed. 

At NSFM, we replaced a printer. There was an issue (who woulda guessed) and it couldn't be pinged. The solution was to delete the existing dhcp reservation and make a new one with a different IP host number. 

After the printer, we then moved to the network closet and started cleaning it up. There were some ports that had patch cables connected to it, but hadn't been used in months. I was on the ladder removing the cables from the unused switch ports my coworker verified through the Cisco Meraki interface. 

When we got back, our sys admin showed the VMs they use, hosted on VMware.
