We started the morning with a team meeting and bagels! The best way to start a day. Everyone gave a quick update on their projects, and then it was off to the clinics.

First, we hit SFM to finish those phone installs. We used the extension cords to bridge the gap where the office layout was a bit poorly designed for tech. After that, we moved to NSFM to replace a printer. Naturally, there was an issue: it wouldn't ping. We ended up deleting the existing DHCP reservation and creating a new one with a different IP host number, which cleared it right up.

The rest of the afternoon was spent in the network closet doing some much-needed cable management. There were several ports with patch cables connected that hadn't been used in months. My coworker used the Cisco Meraki interface to verify which ports were inactive, while I stayed on the ladder pulling the ghost cables out to clean up the rack.

To wrap up the week, our System Admin showed me the virtual machines they use, which are hosted on VMware/vSphere. It's impressive to see how much of the network actually lives on a few powerful servers.
