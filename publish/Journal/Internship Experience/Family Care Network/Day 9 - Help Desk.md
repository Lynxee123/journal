- Answered emails today
- Did help desk today - so got to practice using ninjaOne and the ticketing system. Had a call about deleting contacts from Outlook, but when they tried to remove a contact, it would reappear.
- Got the solution and it was to open Outlook Web and remove it from there and it overrid the desktop version.

- Ryan showed us more on configuring the switches. it was on 802.1x (port-based network access control). and then told us how that connected with their RADIUS server. 
	- shared secret was a big thing
	- want to make sure that only FCN devices can join the FCNnet Wifi
- There was a problem when adding the new switch to the RADIUS server but there wasn't a DNS record - which was resolved lol
