- Did a keyboard replacement 
- A PM asked if we are able to identify the primary user who uses the device we were inquiring about 
	- To try to find the computer:
		- checked NinjaOne and the last logged in user was our sys admin
			- Asked him if he knew where it was > maybe IT was already in possession of it?
		- I check the "New and Retired Computers" and found a computer w/ the same name was retired (L0086); however, the serial numbers didn't match between the one in the spreadsheet and the one in NinjaOne. 
	- SOLUTION: check the tickets > last ticket about that computer was from another manager in the department > in their office and was retrieved. 

- Phones have already been provisioned for FHA for next week's replacement
- Provisioned new laptop using same process as Day 4
