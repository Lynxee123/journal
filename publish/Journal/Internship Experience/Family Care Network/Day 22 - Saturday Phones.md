Usually we don't work on the weekend, but today we're installing new phones and switches at FHA, so we need the downtime. Doin it in the morning!

- Installed 39 total phones at FHA
- Took out all of the switches (3 total), installed 2 switches
	- Cleaned up a BUNCH of ghost cables
	- The switches we replaced the setup with have PoE which is a great investment because our goal is to have the phone at the clinics to all be wired, and it's easier if they get their power in addition to their connection in one cable
	- The two switches are connected to each other with stack cables - so they're essentially one big switch
	- Ryan (sysadmin) did the switch and dns configs like pointing to the new ip
- The PM at FHA got us donuts :)
