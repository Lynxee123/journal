This week gave me a great look at how Family Care Network manages its IT resources and staff. I noticed that they prioritize standardization to make sure routine hardware tasks are handled quickly and without errors. By having these processes down, the team avoids getting bogged down in the basics.

I also learned that managing IT challenges requires a lot of flexibility. Seeing a senior admin pivot to PowerShell when the Microsoft interface changed showed me that being a problem solver is more important than just memorizing a menu. The culture here seems to value both security and people. They are proactive about threats but also very focused on staff well-being.
