Today was my first day as an IT intern at Family Care Network. I kicked things off by getting my name badge and getting my work email sorted. After finishing the online orientation, I got to meet most of the IT team.

I spent some time shadowing a coworker on the help desk to learn about the types of calls they get. One interesting call was about an EKG machine not working—definitely not your typical computer fix. I also started learning about the various software and the ticketing system, I haven't worked with them yet, but I will soon.

The best part of the day was the full tour of the place. We went through every department and met a lot of new people who were all very friendly. Family Care Network has a very chill and inviting space that felt comfortable to work in right from the start. It was also really cool seeing the huge machines they use to test for COVID, influenza, and other labs.
