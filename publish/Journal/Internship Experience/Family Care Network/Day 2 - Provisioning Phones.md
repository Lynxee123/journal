First thing this morning was provisioning new HP Poly Edge VoIP phones. It wasn't very difficult since the team already has the whole process streamlined.

The workflow is simple. You unbox the phone, connect the handset, and plug the main unit into a PoE cord to boot it up. The configuration is easy because it is just connecting to the network and clicking through settings like you would on an iPhone. Once the phone shows its assigned extension, we print a label for the back and package it back up for delivery. We knocked out two full boxes today.

I had to take a quick detour to the Family Health Association to get my blood drawn for a TB test. Unfortunately, that meant I missed the trip out to the Blaine Clinic. While I stayed back at the main office, I kept shadowing help desk calls. A few highlights included a scanner "malfunction" that was actually just paused and a locked account from a few too many mistyped passwords. We also fixed a credit card terminal issue at the Blaine office by remoting in and running an automation script to reinstall the drivers.
