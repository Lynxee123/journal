problem with phones at SFM and IFP.

there are issues with the phone calls dropping or phones going offline. 

watching the phones, the QoS is bad. There seems to be a pattern around the phones connected to wifi are having trouble keeping a stable connection.

Derrick said that a shared excel document with 4 sheets should be created. 
- a list of every extension and if its wired via ethernet, streamline, or wireless. 
- report call issues, extension, time, what the report was
- the other two are the same for the other clinic

Hindsight - the phones should've been all wired in but that costs quite a bit per line.
