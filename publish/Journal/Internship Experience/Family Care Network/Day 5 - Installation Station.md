Apparently, the fiber gods are angry this week. Ryan updated us on another outage. This time, an excavator hit a support line, which lost tension and the fiber line got sucked into a tree. When the fire department showed up, they just cut the fiber line to get it out of the way. It’s a clean rip, but it’s all fixed now! We talked a bit about fiber splicing and how the clinics all point "upstream" to our main data center.

Back at the clinic, there was a classic help desk moment. A user called about a printer and mentioned they tried to "shake the drum unit" to fix it. Please, don't shake the printer parts! 

I spent the rest of the afternoon doing some light hardware installs: a new docking station and a new monitor.

At 5 PM, the team headed to Squalicum Family Medicine (SFM) to install those 30 new Poly phones I provisioned earlier. We had a map of the office and went to work. The front desk was wired up easily, but we ran into some snags in other areas where PoE wasn't available or the desks were just in hard-to-reach places. We’ll have to head back tomorrow with extension cords to finish the job.
