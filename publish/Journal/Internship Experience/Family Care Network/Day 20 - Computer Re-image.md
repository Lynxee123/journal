- Re-image computers that corrupted 
	- One of the computers, when trying to install windows, there wasn't the main partition showing up > solve: checked the sata configuration bios setting and it was on the RAID option and switched it to AHCI mode.
	- Make tickets for the imaged and re-imaged computers
- Helped IT manager install his new monitor... and then helped him go back to his original setup.
- Check up on remote computers that need to be updated
- Visited FHA for IT support
	- Installed new workstation
		- Changed the name
		- Had to change out the power supply > coincidently was searching this up before the visit, but apparently Lenovo has their own propriety power - known as the slim type connection with the yellow ring around it. 
	- Fixed a dual monitor set up - one monitor wasn't displaying anything, but the issue was because both monitor were using the Display port input port- fix: change one of the monitors to be in the DP output and it worked
	- Delivered a re-imaged laptop to a provider, changed the computer name from XXXXX-NEW to XXXXX
- Cleaned up and organized our computer repair station
