This week was a deep dive into how Family Care Network manages **IT resources and infrastructure**. One thing that really impressed me was the security strategy behind their laptop deployment. By using Intune and custom answerfiles to "brick" stolen devices, they protect their hardware investment and patient data simultaneously. It shows they aren't just thinking about how to get a computer to work, but how to manage its entire lifecycle—from the moment it's unboxed to the moment I pull the SSD for e-waste.

I also learned a lot about dealing with technology challenges in the real world. Sometimes the problem isn't a bug in the code; it’s a firefighter cutting a fiber line or a printer drum being shaken by a frustrated user. Seeing the team handle these "physical" challenges with a mix of site visits, manual labor, and network tools like Meraki showed me that being an IT professional requires a lot of versatility. Whether it’s cleaning up a messy network closet or adjusting DHCP reservations, the goal is always the same: keep the clinics running so they can focus on the patients.
