- The Mount Vernon PM emailed me about the last person to sign in to laptop that we need turned on 
	- So i did some investigating. In NinjaOne, I looked at the activity logs for last known users. What I found was last logged on users were from IT remoting in. THe most recent user was Tony, the Helpdesk Supervisor around 2 months ago, running updates remotely. 
	- I also tried looking for associated tickets to the laptop, but didn't see anything either. 
	- I emailed PM back with this information and need to wait for her reply. It's most likely in MV clinic because someone had to turn it on for Tony to remote in 2 months ago.
