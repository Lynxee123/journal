First thing of the day was provisioning new HP Poly Edge VoIP phones, which weren't very difficult as the whole process was already streamlined. 

Quite simply unboxing the phones, connecting the phone piece to the main machine, and then attaching the machine to a PoE cord to start booting up and configuring it. The configuration was quite easy: just connecting it to WiFi and going through the settings, similar to if you were updating your iPhone. 

Once those steps were successfully completed, the phone would show an extension number that we'd print out using a label maker and slap that on the back of the phone. package the phone back up for delivery and that's it. all in all, we provisioned 2 boxes of phones- very fun!

Also took a detour to get my blood drawn at Family Health Association to get tested for TB- even more fun! Unfortunately, because I was occupied with that, I missed out on going to the Blaine Clinic.

While staying at the main office, I continued shadowing help desk phone calls. Some issues:
- Problem with a scanner that was solved on its own. Turns out it was just paused. 
- Locked account from too many miss typed passwords
- Credit card payment not working in the Blaine office > was a driver issue
	- remote into desktop > go to add and remove features > uninstall drivers > reinstall drivers using automation script
